The BBG sisterhood is BBYOâ€™s sorority and where generations of young women have developed their leadership skills, strengthened their Jewish identity, formed lasting friendships, and generally just had lots of fun! BBGs plan, lead, and enjoy social, athletic, community service and Judaic programming either in their own chapter, with other BBGs, or AZA chapters. Among their peers, friends, and with big sisters, young women have fun, embrace tradition and community, and find a voice for themselves!"
