Hello! My name is Mia and I made this chatbot for my chapter of my global Youth Organization called BBYO!
This chatbot utilizes NLP (Natural Language Processing) for individuals to train the AI chatbot on their own for only the information they want.
This chatbot was important to me so that people in my chapter could recieve immediate and accurate information that might not be readily available online about our chapter and events!
Through this project I learned what NLP was and how to utilize it for my chatbot, I improved on my GUI skills in HTML and CSS, I enhanced my programming in Python and Java, 
I fully learned what a Front End and Back End are and how to connect them for my program, I got to explore and better my designing skills to fully plan my own big project for 
the first time, and so much more! I had so much fun making this project and I hope you enjoy it as well!

If you want to use this chatbot for your own use follow these steps:
1. Run pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Update the intent file using your training data
3. Train the chatbot by running the training_model.py file
4. Run the main.py file to start the server
5. Open a browser and type the computer address that was set in main.py
6. Enjoy your chatbot!
